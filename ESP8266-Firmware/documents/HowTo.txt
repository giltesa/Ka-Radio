How to run SHOUTcast player for the first time?

Firstly, you need to make sure that device is working properly. 
After powering up device, you should get (by UART) some boot info and then (at 115.2k baud rate) "UART READY TO READ" message. 
This means that device is ready to get commands by UART. 
If you don't get that message try rebooting device, reflashing it, check your UART connections and baud rate, etc. 
When you send end of line character only (just hit ENTER in terminal emulator (ex. Putty)) you should get response like "#INFO##INFO#". 
After flashing ESP8266 for the first time (using my rom) you need to zero "flash eeprom" (space for user settings in flash). 
To do so type sys.erase and hit ENTER. Remember that device doesn't send echo, which means that you won't see what you're typing!
Now you are ready to connect to your WiFi network. Send command:
wifi.con("YOUR_SSID","YOUR_PASSWORD") [hit ENTER, don't forget about quotation marks!]
Now you should get ##WIFI.CONNECTED# message and some other connection info (IP, etc.). 
It means that device is now connected to your WiFi and your SSID and password are saved.
If you want to connect to this network after rebooting device, just type wifi.con and hit ENTER. 
If device is reconnecting constantly, it means that your SSID or password are wrong and you need to try again. 
Rest of configuration can be done by web interface, available at device's IP by any web browser.
